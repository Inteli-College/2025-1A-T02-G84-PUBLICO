## 2. Introduction

**Communicational accessibility remains a significant barrier in Brazil, especially within corporate environments.** Despite legal and social advances, millions of Deaf individuals continue to face obstacles to full inclusion in the job market. It was from this reality that the idea emerged for an interactive platform to teach Libras (Brazilian Sign Language), developed using technologies such as generative artificial intelligence.
The proposed solution is more than just a learning tool — it serves as a bridge between technological innovation and social impact, enabling companies to train their employees in Libras in a way that is accessible, practical, and scalable. With a gamified learning journey, real-time feedback, and personalized content, the project aims to transform how Libras is taught and understood.
Our goal goes beyond teaching: we seek to build a more inclusive corporate culture, promoting equity and breaking down communication barriers that still exclude millions of talented individuals from the workforce. We believe that by combining technology with purpose, inclusion can become strategy — and Libras, a competitive advantage.

## 3. Problem

**The exclusion of Deaf individuals from the job market goes far beyond a social issue — it is a strategic failure that limits the potential of both companies and professionals.** According to the 2022 IBGE Census, Brazil has approximately 19 million people with some form of disability, of whom only 29.2% are employed, compared to 66.4% of the non-disabled population. This means that more than 12 million Brazilians are out of the workforce, often due to communication barriers and lack of accessibility.
Even with laws that promote inclusion, such as the Quota Law (Law 8.213/91), there is still a significant gap in how companies prepare to integrate Deaf employees. The lack of Libras knowledge among teams and the shortage of interpreters make the workplace unwelcoming. This directly impacts productivity, talent retention, and innovation within organizations.
Beyond internal losses, an entire market is being overlooked. People with disabilities generate over R$ 1.3 trillion annually in Brazil, and companies that neglect accessibility fail to reach this audience. While some corporations are making progress — such as Sodexo, which increased its global revenue by 11.6% through inclusive policies — most still act reactively or symbolically.
Communication is the foundation of any inclusion effort. Without Libras, there is no dialogue. Without dialogue, there is no sense of belonging — nor productivity. And this is exactly where our project comes in: breaking down the language barrier through technology and purpose.

## 4. Approach Taken

**The solution was built at the intersection of technology and social purpose, with the goal of making Libras learning more accessible, interactive, and effective within companies.** To achieve this, we adopted an innovative approach based on the use of artificial intelligence to personalize the learning experience and provide immediate feedback to the user.
Instead of following the traditional model of static or in-person courses, our proposal is dynamic and adaptable: users interact with the platform, practice signs, receive guidance, and track their own progress. All of this is done autonomously, supported by visual resources, gamification, and a performance history.
Artificial intelligence identifies areas where the user needs improvement and suggests content aligned with their context — whether they work in customer service, healthcare, education, or any other field. This ensures a practical, continuous learning experience with direct application in their professional routine.
The approach was also strategically designed for the corporate environment. By offering a scalable solution that can be used by entire teams simultaneously, the platform makes Libras training an integrated part of internal corporate learning — without relying solely on interpreters or external courses.
More than teaching signs, our aim is to foster a culture of inclusion and empathy within organizations — and we believe technology is the most effective bridge to get there.

## 5. How We Discovered This

**To ensure that the proposed solution addressed a real problem and would be well received by the market, we adopted an investigative approach from the very beginning of the project.** The development of the platform was guided by market research, competitor analysis, expert interviews, active listening to potential users, and validation with companies already investing in accessibility.

### Target Audience Research

We collected data through surveys distributed to people from various regions of Brazil, primarily university students and professionals. Most respondents had never had direct contact with Libras but showed interest in learning — especially if the method was practical, interactive, and suited to their daily routines. The main challenges identified were: difficulty memorizing signs, lack of quality learning materials, and absence of feedback during the learning process.

### Business Analysis and Market Acceptance

We evaluated more than 25 large companies that already offer Libras training to their employees, such as Natura, Unilever, OLX, Vivo, Gerdau, and PepsiCo. Most of these initiatives are delivered through traditional courses or partnerships with consulting firms. This confirmed the **existing demand** and genuine interest from the corporate sector, while also revealing a gap in more **technological, engaging, and scalable solutions.**

### Competitor Study

We mapped the main competitors in the Libras learning space, including VLibras, HandTalk, SignAll, and ProDeaf. Although these platforms offer relevant solutions, few provide truly interactive experiences. We identified major gaps, such as the lack of gamification, personalization, and progress tracking — all of which reinforce the unique value of our proposal.

### Strategic Analyses

We applied strategic tools such as SWOT analysis and Porter’s Five Forces to assess the market positioning of our project. The results revealed a landscape with low direct competition, high potential for innovation, and strong opportunities for strategic partnerships — especially with companies that already have diversity and inclusion policies in place.
These studies confirmed that the problem is real, the demand exists, and the market is ready for a **modern, accessible, and impactful solution** like the one we are developing. From that point forward, we advanced with greater confidence and a clear sense of purpose.

## 6. Partnerships and Validation with Companies

**During our research and development process, we sought to understand whether companies would be willing to invest in a technology focused on teaching Brazilian Sign Language (Libras) to their employees. The answer was clear: yes — and in many cases, the demand already exists.**

We mapped over 25 medium and large companies that have already implemented Libras training programs or provide accessible customer service in their communication channels. Among them are well-known names such as PepsiCo, Natura, Unilever, OLX, Vivo, Gerdau, Cielo, Amil, Banco do Brasil, and Magazine Luiza, among others. Many of these initiatives are carried out through in-person courses, one-off partnerships, or traditional internal training sessions — which opens the door for a technological, scalable, and more interactive solution like ours.

### What Companies Are Looking For
####Strategic Partnerships
 In addition to potential client companies, we identified institutions and organizations that can act as strategic partners in the development and expansion of the platform:
 
- **SENAI and Qualifica Guará:** already engaged in providing Libras training within corporate environments.


- **Consultancies such as Oportunidades Especiais and Pessoalize:** specialized in corporate inclusion.


These stakeholders can support the initiative with infrastructure, technical support, content curation, and validation with the Deaf community.

#### Market Validation

Based on interviews, benchmarking, and analysis of real initiatives, we identified a strategic market opportunity for the proposed solution, especially within the B2B model. Most companies already invest in inclusion — but lack tools that truly engage employees and deliver practical results. Our platform fills this gap.
The acceptance of this project, therefore, is far more than a hypothesis — it is a concrete opportunity, validated by data, market behavior, and real movements within the corporate sector.

## 7. Proposed Solution (Summary)

**The solution developed is an interactive platform for teaching Brazilian Sign Language (Libras), primarily designed for corporate environments. Powered by artificial intelligence, the tool enables companies to train their employees in a practical, personalized, and scalable way — promoting real accessibility, engagement, and inclusion.**

Users can input a word or phrase and receive visual guidance on how to perform the corresponding signs. Throughout the learning journey, the system tracks their progress, provides continuous feedback, and encourages learning through gamified elements. This makes the process more dynamic and effective than traditional methods.

### Key Benefits:

By combining technology with social purpose, the platform transforms Libras education into a strategic advantage for companies — while simultaneously advancing the inclusion of Deaf individuals and breaking down long-standing communication barriers.
